### Frontend Module

This project represents the frontend part of the application with the following functionality:
- User authentication and authorization
- Form validation before submitting to the server
- Dashboard with real-time data visualization
- Data editing
- Data sorting and searching
- Autocomplete functionality in the filter input

### CRM Backend

The `crm-backend` folder contains the server-side part of the application, which allows working with data through the API. The rights to `crm-backend` belong to Skillbox.

#### New Functionality

- Added server functionality for autocomplete and hash-based URL handling:
  - `GET /api/clients/autocomplete?query={query}`: Get a list of client autocomplete suggestions based on the query. Parameters passed in the URL:
    * `query={query}`: A string to search for clients by first name, last name, or middle name.
  - `GET /#client_id`: Get a client by their ID from the hash part of the URL. Example:
    ```plaintext
    GET /#12345
    ```
    This method returns an HTML file with the edit client modal window open.
